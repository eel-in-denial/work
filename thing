The Development of LIGO
Introduction
First proposed in 1915, Einstein's theory of general relativity resulted in a number of predicted physical consequences including the curvature of light and the existence of blackholes (Tillman, Bartels & Dutfield, 2022). One such prediction was the existence of gravitational waves - ripples in space-time that stretch and contract space as they propagated (Rothman, 2018). LIGO, or Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory is an observatory constructed to detect such gravitational waves emanating from large celestial bodies. By utilising laser interferometry, LIGO has not only been able to detect gravitational waves, but has additionally been able to identify their source, whether from the collision of two black holes or the mutual orbit of two neutron stars (Rothman, 2018). The achievement of such a feat was only possible through constant technological innovation. In this report, the science behind gravitational waves and laser interferometry will be explored, while analysing LIGO’s connection to the SHE strand of development.

Science - Gravitational waves
According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, mass and energy are able to curve space-time. Gravity can therefore be thought of as the curvature of space-time rather than a force as described in Newtonian Physics (LIGO Caltech, 2019). This can be demonstrated through the analogy of heavy objects being placed on a tarp as the consequent depression caused other objects to attract as demonstrated in Figure 1. Additionally, Einstein's theory of general relativity states that gravity is not instantaneous but instead propagates as radiation at the speed of light. Extending the analogy of a tarp, this mirrors the speed at which energy is transferred through the surface rather than instantaneously creating a depression (Steve Mould, 2016). This results in accelerating objects creating ripples in space-time in the form of gravitational waves that stretch and compress space as shown in Figure 2. However, as the waves created by most objects are too small to detect, only massive bodies travelling at high speeds - such as binary neutron stars - create waves that are feasibly detectable. Even then, these waves stretch and compress the 4 kilometre arms of LIGO by a length of one thousandth the diameter of a proton as the amplitude of gravitational waves are inversely proportional to the distance travelled (LIGO Caltech, 2019). As gravitational waves do not strongly interact with matter, unlike electromagnetic radiation, this has allowed for clearer observations of far away neutron stars and black holes (Sormani, 2017).

Science - Light Interferometry
As the acronym suggests, LIGO detects the distortion of space-time from gravitational waves through laser interferometry. A laser is shot at a mirror, splitting the beam of light into two separate beams that traverse perpendicular channels as shown in Figure 3. The lengths of the two channels are set so that when the two beams of light reflect and recombine, they have a phase difference of 180 degrees or half a wavelength. According to the principle of superposition, the phenomenon of interference (where two or more waves intersect) creates a resultant wave that is an algebraic sum of the combined initial waves (University of Connecticut, 2019). Therefore, as demonstrated by the central diagram in Figure 4, the light waves from LIGO cause complete destructive interference resulting in no light as the trough of one wave aligns with the peak of the other. However the distortion of space-time caused by gravitational waves stretches the length of one channel while compressing the length of the other before stretching and compressing in the opposite direction as further demonstrated by Figure 4. This periodically misaligns the two light beams and creates partially constructive interference, allowing for the detection of light (LIGO Caltech, 2019).

A large concern in the detection of gravitational waves is the noise caused by quantum mechanics. The cause of this noise is the variance in amplitude (Da) and phase (D) of both light and gravitational radiation as demonstrated in Figure 5. This variance occurs due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that states there is a limit to how precisely certain pairs of physical properties can be measured. Mathematically, the limit of the two properties can be represented as DaD>1 where the product of both uncertainties must be greater than one (MIT Kavli Institute, 2018). The variance in phase creates shot noise, where the differing phases cause partial constructive interference even without the presence of gravitational waves. As high-frequency waves have short wavelengths, the effects of a varying phase are much more prominent in the detection of high-frequency gravitational waves (LIGO Caltech, 2019). Comparatively, a large variance in amplitude results in radiation pressure noise. This is due to the wave-particle duality of light, where light radiation with a large amplitude can be interpreted as an increase in photons being emitted. This increases the effects of radiation pressure as the photons transfer some of their momentum to the hanging mirrors by colliding with matter particles (Miller, 2024). This causes the mirrors to oscillate and vary the distance that light travels. As the mirrors oscillate at a low-frequency, this noise largely affects the detection of low-frequency gravitational waves.

Development
The development of LIGO started with the theorization of gravitational waves, first proposed as the gravitational equivalent of electromagnetic waves by Oliver Heaviside in 1893 (Caltech, n.d.). However, the first theoretical proof of gravitational waves came from Einstein’s theory of general relativity in 1916, where he demonstrated that gravitational waves were a solution to linearized general relativity. However, as there was no solution for gravitational waves in the nonlinear framework, Einstein doubted their existence, preventing the development of technology to detect such phenomena (Sormani, 2017). After his death, through the work of a number of physicists, a solution to gravitational waves was found within Einstein’s gravitational field equations. This gave the ‘green light’ for experimental physicists to start designing detection methods, in the hopes of further testing the validity of the theory of general relativity. A key requirement for the completion of LIGO was the development of lasers, which coincidentally arose from the foundational theory of stimulated emission described by Einstein in 1917 (American Physics Society, 2024). Prototypes for lasers were made during the 1950s and 1960s, around the same time physicists were attempting to design a way of detecting gravitational waves. Physicists therefore realised laser interferometry’s potential to measure relativistic distances, leading to the first proposed laser interferometer in 1962. 

Due to the extreme precision needed to record gravitational waves, any noise in the data reduces the readability drastically. Therefore, the development of noise reduction is a high priority for LIGO. One of the most important developments in laser interferometry was computational analysis of frequency data (CPLB, 2020). LIGO utilises dual detectors located in different areas of America with a distance of 3002 kilometres as shown in Figure 6. Through the use of computers, the datasets from both facilities can be compared and combined, allowing for the exclusion of local vibrations in the earth caused by vehicles and tectonic movement while keeping any commonalities between the data. Additionally, the fastest that a gravitational wave can propagate from one facility to the other is about 10 milliseconds. This means that any supposed commonalities that have a time interval larger than 10 milliseconds can automatically be discounted and removed from the data by certain algorithms, isolating the signal created by gravitational waves (Caltech, n.d.). Without the development of computational analysis, many external factors could not be accounted for, greatly increasing the difficulty of detecting gravitational waves.

After constant improvements in external noise reduction and equipment stability, LIGO reached a point where the sensitivity of the machinery was limited by the variance in amplitude and phase of waves caused by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. The largest issue was the variance in phase which caused shot noise, as LIGO measures the interference caused by the unalignment of phases. Therefore, LIGO utilised phase quantum squeezing in 2019, where by manipulating the vacuum space that light passes through, the electromagnetic radiation would enter a squeezed coherent state (caltech, 2023). In this state, the variance in the light’s phase is greatly reduced while the uncertainty in amplitude increases to maintain DaD>1. However, this consequently causes an increase in radiation pressure noise, greatly impacting the detection of low-frequency gravitational waves as demonstrated by the green data in Figure 7 (Miller, 2024). The solution to this was the development of frequency-dependent squeezing where the detection of high-frequency gravitational waves would cause the light to be phase squeezed while the detection of low-frequency gravitational waves would cause the light to be amplitude squeezed. It was found that a phase squeezed vacuum could be transformed into an amplitude squeezed vacuum simply through delaying it by a quarter of a wave cycle (Miller, 2024). Therefore by developing a chamber where “low-frequency components of the squeezed vacuum enter… and ricochet around for a while before exiting” while the high-frequency components are not affected, frequency-dependent quantum squeezing was achieved. As demonstrated by the purple data in Figure 7, this maintained the reduced noise in the detection of high-frequency gravitational waves without increasing the noise in low-frequency gravitational waves.

Conclusion
In conclusion, LIGO represents a monumental feat in human innovation. First created to further test Einstein’s theory of general relativity, the facility has proven the existence of gravitational waves while also detecting celestial bodies too far for electromagnetic telescopes to detect. Through the development of computational analysis, physicists have been able to compare the data recorded from the dual LIGO facilities and reduce external noise factors, while developments in the field of quantum optics have allowed for the implementation of the first ever frequency dependent quantum squeezing. LIGO therefore represents 100 years of human innovation, from the proposal of gravitational relativity and the laser, all the way to manipulating light at a quantum level.
